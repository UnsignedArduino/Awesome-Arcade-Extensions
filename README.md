# MakeCode Arcade Extensions
This is a list of MakeCode Arcade extensions that I find super useful in my projects. If you would like to suggest an extension be added, please open an issue with a link to the extension on GitHub. Or even better, open a pull request for adding an extension! Make sure to include a description, import url, links to it's GitHub repo, GitHub Pages example if any, forum post showcasing the extension if any, and an entry in the table of contents!

You can find the old Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/UnsignedArduino/3bc2adce4b3f687ea1967578449d014d).

A version of the `Animation` extension but much more easier to handle if your sprites (Ex. main player) has a lot of different movements, like moving up, down, left, and right. The `character-animations` extension will automatically start and stop animations depending on what the player is doing. This will add another category in the toolbox called `Character`.

## Not built-in extensions
The following extensions, while just as good as the ones listed above, will require some slightly different steps while importing. First go to the toolbox, open the `Advanced` tab, click on `Extensions`, and you will see a text box that says `Search or enter project URL...`. This is where you will paste in the URL to the extension. The URL will be posted along with the listing.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/felixtsu/pxt-sight) | [Demo](https://arcade.makecode.com/97022-62922-00013-89813) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/sneaking-demo/4961)

### smaller-tilemaps
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/riknoll/smaller-tilemaps

Now we get 4x4, 2x2, and "1x1, at your own risk" tilemaps! Initialize a tilemap and use 4x4 or 2x2 or 1x1 images to manually draw your tiles by code. Note this extension was made in 1 hour so it may be buggy and performance will not be as good as a 8x8 or 16x16 tilemap. This will add a `Smaller Tilemaps` category.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/riknoll/smaller-tilemaps)

### arcade-background-scroll
> NOTE: This extension is depreciated! There is a new better extension under the same name but different repo that is now part of the built-in extensions!

### pxt-image-morph
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/UnicycleDumpTruck/pxt-image-morph

"Morph" images in MakeCode Arcade! Very cool for switching between images and could be used in say, the reveal of a bad guy's true form! Also very fun for switching between images that are used as instructions instead of a snap change which is boring. This adds an `Imagemorph` category in the toolbox. 

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/UnicycleDumpTruck/pxt-image-morph) | [Demo](https://arcade.makecode.com/04630-02278-77688-89486) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/pixel-by-pixel-morphing-slows-down/2980/7?u=unsignedarduino)

### pxt-real-multiplayer
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/distintiva/pxt-real-multiplayer

Makes coding multiplayer games over JACDAC easier! It also works in the simulator as well! Note at the time of writing, JACDAC for Arcade is in the middle of a rewrite so things are most likely broken. This will add a `Real Multiplayer` category to the toolbox.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/distintiva/pxt-real-multiplayer) | [Demo](https://arcade.makecode.com/84138-42853-06448-38206) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/new-extension-real-multiplayer-with-blocks/1202)

### TilemapPath
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TilemapPath

Don't manually place walls to make your A-star paths do what you want, use this! You can set a sprite to follow a path between tilemap locations and have handlers when they finish. Note that everytime you set a path, it will recalculate the paths using the A-star extension which can take a long time depending on how big the tilemap is and how many elements there are. This extension adds a `TilemapPath` category. 

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TilemapPath) | [Demo](https://makecode.com/_87j1jxLV358K) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/tilemappath-extension/9480)

### arcade-premium-life
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/jwunderl/arcade-premium-life

It's life but _better_. This extension uses the default set life and change life by blocks to change the values, but for configuring the look you can use the blocks in the `Profile Life` category. 

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/jwunderl/arcade-premium-life) | [Demo](https://jwunderl.github.io/arcade-premium-life/)

### ColorBlock
Import this extension with the URL:

### arcade-camera-offset
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/riknoll/arcade-camera-offset

This simple extension adds a block to the `Scene` category that allows you to follow a sprite with the camera with an offset! Much better then hacking a sprite to always be off a certain amount.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Musical-Images) | [Demo](https://makecode.com/_0t46cj0j24jH)

### pxt-sound-effects
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/klausw3/pxt-sound-effects

This extension allows custom sound effects other than the boring square wave! This adds a new category called "Sound Effects".

### arcade-snapshot
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/AqeeAqee/arcade-snapshot

This extension allows you to take a screenshot of the screen, or a snapshot of the current tilemap and print it on the console! It will add a category called "Snapshot". 

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/AqeeAqee/arcade-snapshot) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/a-snapshot-extension-for-screen-or-tilemap/13064)

### pxt-deltatime
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/kiwiphoenix364/pxt-deltatime

This small extension adds a category called "Delta" which has a single block that exposes the delta time function in blocks, so projects that rely movement or time based on frames can work when the game is running slower than expected! Make sure to look at the [example](https://makecode.com/_Y0j7ef139dmo) on how to use it!

### pxt-blur
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/kiwiphoenix364/pxt-blur

This extension allows you to blur the screen in and out, just like the Colors extension does with fading! This adds a category called "Blur".

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Awesome-Arcade-Extensions/issues/45) | [Demo](https://arcade.makecode.com/46662-72254-40051-03086) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/blur-extension/12135)

### pxt-zoom
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/kiwiphoenix364/pxt-zoom

This extension allows you to zoom in or out of the screen by calling a single block in an `on game update` block! A very simple (0 < x < 1 for zoom out, and x > 1 to zoom in, and negatives for flipping screen upside down) extension that adds a "Zoom" category in the toolbox.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/kiwiphoenix364/pxt-zoom) | [Demo](https://arcade.makecode.com/55896-03193-59005-39058) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/zoom-extension/13745)

### arcade-sprite-events
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/riknoll/arcade-sprite-events

The default sprite overlap and tilemap overlap blocks are called _for every frame it is happening_, which can lead to unexpected results. You can use a state variable to only run code when you start and stop overlapping sprites/tiles/areas, but that is annoying. This extension adds new blocks which make it great for advanced tilemap games or making sprite overlaps easier! This adds a category called "Sprite Events".

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/riknoll/arcade-sprite-events) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/arcade-sprite-events-extension/13453?u=unsignedarduino)

### arcade-mini-menu
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/riknoll/arcade-mini-menu

This extension is a much more advanced and highly customizable version of (the now depreciated) [arcade-custom-menu](#arcade-custom-menu) that has _tons_ of options to customize your menus to fit your game's theme! The menu is also a sprite, which allows you to use all standard sprite blocks on it. This adds a category to the toolbox called "Mini Menu".

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/riknoll/arcade-mini-menu) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/arcade-mini-menu-extension/14368?u=unsignedarduino) | [Demo](https://riknoll.github.io/arcade-mini-menu/)

## Experimental-extensions

Shouldn't need an explanation: "VERY UNSTABLE" - @livcheerful

### arcade-soundtrack
Import this extension with the URL:
> https://github.com/livcheerful/arcade-soundtrack

In this extension you can make soundtracks within images! But it is pretty confusing and "might break your game." This extension was made by @livcheerful in a hackathon.

[GitHub](https://github.com/livcheerful/arcade-soundtrack) | [Forum post](https://forum.makecode.com/t/hackathon-link-request/9751/2?u=unsignedarduino) | [Demo](https://arcade.makecode.com/10829-55411-68884-03658) 

## Tools
Yes, this is about useful MakeCode Arcade extensions but these tools will level up your game-making experience!
### Convert-Image-to-MakeCode-Arcade-Sprite
This tool will convert your images (like `.png` files) to Arcade code! Simply copy the output, open JavaScript mode in your project, navigate to where you want the image block to go, and paste in the image code! You may need to remove some redundant characters. Remember that Arcade has a maximum image size of 500x500!

### pxt-arcade-asset-tool
This tool will also convert you images to Arcade code, but it also supports using 16-color palettes, in case you don't want to use the default palette! Simply copy the output, open JavaScript mode, navigate to where you want the image to go, and paste away! You may need to remove some redundant characters.

### arcade-sprite-pack
Have a bunch of images you want to send to someone, but they hate exercising their pinkie and pointer finger? This will convert a set of images into a MakeCode project that, when you import, will put the images into the image gallery! And as of December 2021, this tool has been updated to be even better than before, with support for animations, tiles, and tilemaps!

### games-gallery
@jacobcarpenter [on GitHub](https://github.com/jacobcarpenter) has written a neat tool that scrapes the [MakeCode Forum's arcade section](https://forum.makecode.com/c/share-your-arcade-projects-here/5) and shows the games in a gallery-like view! So you don't have to ~~suffer~~ and scroll through debug programs and tons of comments to find that dang link. You can also view the most liked-games of all-time and by author, like [me](https://games-gallery.jacobcarpenter.com/author/416) for example hehe.

### Image-to-MakeCode-Arcade

I have written a Python script that will turn images and multi-frame GIFs into MakeCode Arcade images and arrays! Note that this tools requires at least Python 3.9 on a computer, and command line knowledge is highly recommended!
